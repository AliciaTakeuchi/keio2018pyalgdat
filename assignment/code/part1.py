    # 1. Load corpus data using your load_corpus_data function.
    # 2. Use the save_pkl utility function to save this data to a file named
    #    data.pkl
    # 3. Obtain the word frequency dictionary using your get_word_freq function.
    # 4. Use the save_json utility function to save the word frequency
    #    dictionary to a file named wfd.json
    # 5. Obtain two lists of words: top 100 and top 5000.
    # 6. Save the two lists in two files named top_100_list.txt and
    #    top_5000_list.txt respectively. Write plain text words, one word per
    #    line. You will need to write your own code for that (instead of using a
    #    function). Refer to your lecture notes or Python documentation for
    #    how to do that. The words should be ordered by decreasing frequency.
    # 7. Generate a frequency graph for the top 100 words, and use the
    #    graph_top_k function to save it to a file named top_100_fig.png
    # 8. Answer the question: What type of behavior do English words exhibit?
    #    What is the class of functions that describe such behavior? What is the
    #    name of this law in linguistics? Answers should be inside comments.
