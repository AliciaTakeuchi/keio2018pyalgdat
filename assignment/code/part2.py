    # 1. Load corpus data using the load_pkl utility function.
    # 2. Use your implementation of get_context_dictionary to obtain context
    #    data for all the words in the corpus. You need to obtain the list of
    #    all words first.
    # 3. Save the computed context dictionary to a file named cd.pkl using the
    #    save_pkl utility function.
    # 4. Answer the question: Why do we care about word contexts? What kind of
    #    information can co-occurrence patterns (contexts) of words provide?
